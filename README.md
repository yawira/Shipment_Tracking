# Shipment Tracking 

The Shipment Tracking application provides information on all aspects of a shipment. 
Only a tracking number is required for the query. The user receives the following details:

- Delivery Status (Placed shipment, in delivery, delivered)
- Delivery Method (Express or Standard)
- Shipping and Delivery Address

If a shipment can't be found, a Help-page is offered.
